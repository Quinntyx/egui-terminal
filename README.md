Thank you to @leelee.rs on Discord (or [melody-rs](https://github.com/melody-rs) on Github) for some of the code I used and for suggesting the approach. Some code is taken from her project, [Luminol](https://github.com/Astrabit-St/Luminol), specifically luminol-term. 

Big thanks to [wez](https://github.com/wez) as well for creating WezTerm, which I used for this project.
